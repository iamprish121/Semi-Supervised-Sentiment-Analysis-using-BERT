# Semi-Supervised-Sentiment-Analysis-using-BERT
Project Explanation: SSL-based Sentiment Classification using BERT
This project applies Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) to sentiment classification using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). It leverages the SST-2 dataset (Stanford Sentiment Treebank-2), a dataset commonly used for sentiment analysis tasks.

Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to build a sentiment classification model that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning. It aims to improve the performance of sentiment classification while reducing dependency on large labeled datasets.

Workflow
Dataset Preparation

The SST-2 dataset is loaded using the Hugging Face datasets library.
The first 2000 instances are selected for training.
The sentences are tokenized using BERT tokenizer (bert-base-uncased).
Model Selection & Training

BERT is used as the base model for encoding text inputs.
The model is fine-tuned using PyTorch for binary sentiment classification (Positive vs. Negative).
Training data is shuffled and processed into tensors.
Semi-Supervised Learning Approach

A portion of labeled data is used for supervised training.
The model generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, which are refined iteratively.
Confidence thresholds determine which pseudo-labels are retained.
Evaluation & Visualization

The trained model is evaluated on a test set.
The accuracy and performance metrics (e.g., F1-score, Precision, Recall) are calculated.
A bar chart visualization is generated to analyze label distribution.
Use Cases
Sentiment Analysis for Social Media: Classifies tweets, Facebook comments, and product reviews.
Customer Feedback Analysis: Helps businesses analyze user sentiments in reviews.
Low-Resource NLP Tasks: Improves classification accuracy where labeled data is scarce.
AI-Powered Chatbots: Enhances chatbot understanding of user emotions.
